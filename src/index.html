          </h1>
          <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-loose font-serif">
            This elderly man is named Raju. He has his name tattooed on his
            hand. Raju makes a living for his family by driving a rickshaw in
            the heart of Yangon. At the age of 56, Raju resides in Dala, a town
            across the river from Yangon. <br />

            Have you noticed the expression on Raju’s face, reflecting a
            system’s decay? Only if you desire to see it will you truly perceive
            it. It is possible that you might not empathize with this because
            you have not experienced it yourself. <br />

            Raju’s left eye is clouded over, yet his right eye still has the
            opportunity to witness the complexities and beauty of Yangon.
            Successive regimes have systematically oppressed the masses. The
            oppressive rulers have methodically destroyed the education system,
            indoctrinating the populace with distorted ideologies, and thus
            abusing education. Since the coup in 2021, the already struggling
            working class has sunk deeper into the mire. Ultimately, the people
            from the working class have become like frogs trapped in a well.
            <br />

            Look closely at the smile on Raju’s face. It carries a faint smile
            mocking the decaying system. People like Raju endure much hardship
            in Myanmar.

            U Phone Myint founded a small library named "Pyithu Alin" in one of
            Yangon’s townships. This haven he created became a sanctuary for
            elderly grandparents, serving as a cherished retreat. The elderly
            found solace there, surrounded by books, journals, and love, and it
            became their second home where they could communicate with each
            other. This little haven alleviated their loneliness and thrived for
            nearly a decade. However, following the military coup in 2021, their
            second home was destroyed. Now, this haven lives on in the heart of
            an eighty-year-old grandfather. No gun can ever extinguish our
            feelings.

            The dog's name is Kan Kaung. He was abandoned in a garbage dump in
            Dala Township, on the outskirts of Yangon, during a rainstorm. When
            he was abandoned, three of his legs were broken. He was rescued and
            adopted from that garbage dump by a woman who sells snacks for a
            living. Her compassion gave Kan Kaung a chance to survive. <br />

            The woman travels from Dala to Yangon daily, carrying Kan Kaung in
            her bicycle basket, to the place where she sells snacks. Kan Kaung
            is always by her side. Because Kan Kaung is a disabled dog, the
            woman takes care of his needs, including those related to his
            injuries. <br />

            She belongs to the working-class, living day by day, selling snacks
            on platforms in Yangon. Her status and love for Kan Kaung are not
            materialistic. <br />

            Their bond has lasted for nearly four years. In this world, there
            are still forms of love that cannot be bought with money or power.

          <p class="text-lg mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-8 font-serif">
            The settlement near the Botahtaung waterfront is a fragile home for
            homeless families. One family, living amidst the bustling Botahtaung
            waterfront, makes ends meet primarily by selling bird feed and fish.
            The children from these families often collect beer cans and liquor
            bottles. Some of them ask for money from people drinking alcohol
            near the waterfront. A few of the children sell bird feed. Among
            these children, some have dropped out of school due to the family's
            need to survive. <br />

            They couldn't achieve a bright future because they didn't reach the
            turning point in their education. They faced life's challenges in
            ways beyond their age. Despite being so young, they managed to take
            care of their basic needs through their own efforts. After the coup
            in 2021, everything became more difficult for the lower classes. Rey
            Rey is a child who hasn't been to school yet. When I first met Rey
            Rey, he wasn't wearing shoes. The next time we met, his grandmother
            had bought him a pair of shoes because he had managed to get more
            money the previous day. A basic necessity that a child should easily
            have, he had to struggle to obtain. This is a comedy from a world
            you wouldn't want to see.

            He is an ordinary person who drives a ferry between Yangon and Dala
            (Thamada Beach). He is the head of his household and has a naturally
            chubby build. He has accepted this as an unchangeable aspect of his
            appearance. Dala is a township where many of Yangon's working-class
            people live. After the military seized power, the resulting economic
            downturn directly impacted his family. The ferries, which use
            diesel, have become more difficult to operate due to the rising fuel
            costs. The meager income from driving the ferry is just enough to
            feed his family of five for the day. His daily earnings are only
            sufficient for their daily meals.
            <br />
            The root of all these problems is the oppressive system. The real
            culprit is the authoritarian regime. Now, his family is worried
            about being unjustly conscripted into the military, following the
            illegal conscription law issued by the military government on
            February 10. While wealthier people can bribe officials to avoid
            conscription, this issue has reached the doorsteps of working-class
            families in the city.
